# REMEMBER YOUR DATA SET MUST HAVE TITLES
## BEFORE STARTING
As I _always_ forget, __Ctrl + Shift + ↓__ to go to the end of a data set! (numbskull!)
## REMOVE DUPLICATES
__Look for function in the Data Section__
## REMOVE BLANKS
__Ctrl + G -> Blanks__
## FLASH FILL
When combining data from two columns into one, add a new column, start entering the data as per the two adjacent columns you want to combine and then either Ctrl + E or in the data tools, click Flash fill.
## FILTERING
It’s _DIFFERENT_ from sorting. Click the filter button in your column header… if, for example, you want to see all items beginning with “N”, in the search box, enter “N*” (the letter you want plus an asterisk). Et voilà.
You can remove the filter by clicking the filter button on the right-hand side of the column heading.
### CUSTOM FILTERING (Applies to Text and Numbers in a Similar Way)
If you want to filter by column to select cells that either:
* contain
* are equal to
Etc, such as the table below:

Destinations | Phone   | Commission Paid
 ---- | ---- | ---- 
Fargo-East | (612) 555-3976 | No
Fargo-East | (612) 555-3940 | No
Fargo-North | (612) 555-3930 | No
Fargo-North | (612) 555-3953 | No
Fargo-South | (612) 555-3982 | Yes
Fargo-South | (612) 555-3960 | No
Fargo-West | (612) 555-3962 | Yes
Fargo-West | (612) 555-3964 | Yes

From the column menu (the filter button on the right of the column), select _“Text Filters”_ and YOYOM. Pretty self-evident.
If it were for numbers, it would be , select _“Number Filters”_ and YOYOM. Pretty self-evident.
## Row Totals and Automatic Functions
From the table formatting tool, you can add a Totals row.
Look at the cool image below and YOYOM.

You can toggle the __Total__ row on/off… it will always remember how you left it upon last save.
## ADDING NEW ROWS TO A DATA SET 
In the last cell of the table / dataset either:
* Tab
* Drag the handler
Simple as…
### Converting a Table to a Range (and back)
REMEMBER: IF YOU WANT YOUR TABLE TO BE A RANGE YOU MUST SELECT: __Convert to Range__ in the _Design_ tab. The Table Formatting part of the Ribbon is no longer displayed.
To revert this, from the __Home__ tab, select __Styles -> Format as Table__
# CONDITIONAL FORMATTING
Just select the column you want and use the options in the Conditional Formatting group. YOYOM.

Look at the __Data Bars / Color Scales / Icon Sets… New Rules / Manage Rules__…. It’s all there!
## INTERESTING FUNCTIONALITY WITHIN CONDITIONAL FORMATTING GROUP
The wealth of __Conditional Formatting__ Functionality
